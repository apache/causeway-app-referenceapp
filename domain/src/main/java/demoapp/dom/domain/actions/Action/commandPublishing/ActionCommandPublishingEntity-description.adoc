This domain class is used in the demo of `@Action#commandPublishing`.

== How this demo works

This entity has two actions, each of which can be used to change its name.
One of the actions is published, the other is not.

Invoking the published action will result in a command representing the action invocation being persisted; these are listed in the collection at the bottom of the page.

In terms of code:

* action with command publishing enabled:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.ActionCommandPublishingEntity_changeNamePublished.java
----
include::ActionCommandPublishingEntity_changeNamePublished.java[tags=class]
----
<.> enables command publishing

* contributed collection showing persisted ``CommandLogEntry``s:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.ActionCommandPublishingEntity_changeNamePublished.java
----
include::ActionCommandPublishingEntity_publishedCommands.java[tags=class]
----
<.> repository provided by the _commandLog_ extension.
