The link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/PropertyLayout.html#navigable[@PropertyLayout#navigable] attribute allows the viewer to construct a breadcrumb trail.
It is commonly used with objects forming a hierarchy, and so often is used in conjunction with the `TreeNode` value type.

== How this demo works

This demo app uses the filesystem of the host computer to illustrate the idea:

* This page you are viewing is a view model object, called `FileNodeVm`.
It represents either a directory or a file within that filesystem.

* Every instance of `FileNodeVm` shows the same `TreeNode` instance, on the left hand side.
This is contributed by a mixin property, and is cached on HTTP session.
You can use this to navigate into the tree and inspect the individual files, without "losing your place".

* When you have drilled into the tree, a breadcrumb panel will appear near the top of the page.
+
This occurs because the `FileNodeVm` uses `@PropertyLayout#navigable`.

=== Navigable (Breadcrumbs)

For all ``FileNodeVm``s except the initial root node, a breadcrumb trail is rendered.

The framework constructs the breadcrumbs using the value returned by the property with the `navigable` attribute.
This hint should be used on no more than one property of the object, and points back to the logical parent of the domain object:

[source,java,indent=0]
.FileNodeVm.java
----
include::FileNodeVm.java[tags=navigable]
----
<.> indicates that this property returns a reference to its "parent" within some hierarchy
<.> there is no requirement for the property to be visible.

In the case of this demo app, the parent also happens to be a `FileNodeVm`.
However, in general, any type of the parent can be different from the type of the child.

The returned parent is itself queried recursively, until eventually an object is returned that has no parent.
The framework renders the breadcrumbs from this sequence of parents.

TIP: For a domain entity, the implementation above would be a lookup of the parent entity from a repository.
For a view model, we can simply instantiate the parent because view models have value semantics in this respect.

=== Icon

It's common for hierarchical objects to indicate their nature using an icon:

[source,java,indent=0]
.FileNodeVm.java
----
include::FileNodeVm.java[tags=iconName]
----

where `FileNodeType` is:

[source,java,indent=0]
.FileNodeType.java
----
include::FileNodeType.java[tags=class]
----

Note that there are SVG files for each of the instances of this enum, namely `FileNodeVm-FILE_SYSTEM_ROOT.svg`, `FileNodeVm-DIRECTORY.svg` and `FileNodeVm-FILE.svg`.


=== Tree

As described above, every `FileNode` renders the same tree.
This is contributed by a mixin property:

[source,java,indent=0]
.FileNodeVm_tree.java
----
include::FileNodeVm_tree.java[tags=class]
----

The tree instance itself is cached by a `FileTreeNodeService`, so that there is no need to track the state of the tree (which nodes are expanded etc).
The `FileTreeNodeService` in turn uses `HttpSession` as the actual in-memory cache:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::FileTreeNodeService.java[tags=sessionTree]
----

The `TreeNode` value type itself is created using:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::FileTreeNodeService.java[tags=newTree]
----

This requires an implementation of the `TreeAdapter<T>` SPI, discussed next.

==== TreeAdapter SPI

To render a `TreeNode`, the application must provide an implementation of the `TreeAdapter<T>` SPI:

[source,java]
----
public interface TreeAdapter<T> {
    public Optional<T> parentOf(T value);
    public int childCountOf(T value);
    public Stream<T> childrenOf(T value);
}
----

In the case of the demo app, the implementation is `FileSystemTreeAdapter`, which navigate the host computer's filesystem:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::FileSystemTreeAdapter.java[tags=class]
----
