Embedded types are a feature of the JDO ORM that an entity to a field of a composite type which groups several data fields together.
The values of the composite type are then stored inline within the entity's table.
Such embedded types have no identity in and of themselves; they are identified only by the entity that references them.

Embedded types themselves can be mutable or immutable.
When immutable, they are very similar to value types.
However, they are not quite true value types as the ORM needs to update their fields directly.
To enable that, a mutator method is required, though it can be made `private`.


== How this demo works

This page object has a collection `allConstants` that just returns a set of `NumberConstantJdo` entities.
The `NumberConstantJdo` entity defines a `name` property (of type `String`) and a `numberConstant` property (of type `ComplexNumberJdo`).
It is this second property that we are interested in.

In terms of code:

* the `NumberConstantJdo` entity is defined as:
+
[source,java]
.NumberConstantJdo.java
----
include::NumberConstantJdo.java[tags=class]
----
<.> JDO `@Embedded` annotation indicates that the constituent parts of the embedded type should be stored as columns of the owning entity

* the `ComplexNumberJdo` is the embedded type:
+
[source,java]
.ComplexNumberJdo.java
----
include::ComplexNumberJdo.java[tags=class]
----
<.> JDO `@EmbeddedOnly` annotation is the companion of `@Embedded` on the owning object.
<.> with presence of `@EmbeddedOnly` should not be required; but app fails on launch if not provided.
<.> Indicates to the framework that this is a value rather than an entity.
Accordingly, we will also need to provide a `ValueSemanticsProvider` implementation, discussed below.
<.> provides access the fields
<.> allows the ORM to initialize the fields
<.> these fields of the embedded type are persisted as columns of the owning entity

* the `ComplexNumberJdoValueSemantics` class instructs the framework how to render the `ComplexNumberJdo` as a value.
