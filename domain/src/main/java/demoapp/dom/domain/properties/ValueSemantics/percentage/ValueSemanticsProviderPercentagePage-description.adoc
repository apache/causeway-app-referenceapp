The link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/value/semantics/ValueSemanticsProvider.html[ValueSemanticsProvider] SPI provides a mechanism to customise the way in which the framework interacts with value types, both simple scalar value types (consisting of a single value) and composite value types (multiple values).

If required, the value type class can be a custom class, such as `EmailAddress`.
But often what is required is simply a relatively minor customisation of an existing basic type.

A good example is percentages.
While it would be possible to create a custom `Percentage` value type, in other use cases an existing value type such as `java.math.BigDecimal` might suffice.
However, when rendered we would like the decimal to show as a percentage, so that 0.5 is 50%, or 0.02 is 2%.

== How this demo works

On the left hand side of this page is a single editable property, shown as a percentage.
In fact, this property is defined as a `java.math.BigDecimal`, but it uses a `ValueSemanticsProvider` to represent it as a percentage.

In terms of code:

* the `ValueSemanticsProvider` inherits from the framework's own provider for ``BigDecimal``s:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ValueSemanticsProviderForPercentage.java[tags=class]
----
<.> must be defined as a Spring `@Component` (a singleton)
<.> must define a unique Spring `@Qualifier`
<.> inherits from the framework-provided provider for `BigDecimal`
<.> overrides the `htmlPresentation(...)` method to customise the representation

* the `Percentage` meta-annotation references the provider:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::Percentage.java[tags=class]
----
<.> references the above provider using its `@Qualifier`

* the page's property is annotated with the `@Percentage` meta-annotation:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ValueSemanticsProviderPercentagePage.java[tags=property]
----
<.> annotated with the meta-annotation
