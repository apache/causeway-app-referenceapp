This is an link:https://causeway.apache.org[Apache Causeway] application to demonstrate the various features of the framework.

On the left hand side of each page you'll find a working example of the feature, while on the right hand side you'll find a description of the feature with annotated code examples.

Be aware, the demo app uses an in-memory database, so any changes made will be lost when the app is stopped.

== Page Layout

This is as good place as any to explain the page layout of an Apache Causeway webapp:

* At the top is the menu bar.
+
This consists of a *primary menu* (on the left) containing the actions provided by the app's domain service, a *secondary menu* (on the right) which typically contains supporting services provided by the framework itself (eg "Prototyping") or extensions, and the *tertiary menu* for login/logout and inspecting the configuration.

* In the centre (where you're looking now) is the domain object being displayed.
+
This will have an *icon* and *title*, for identification by the user.
A typical web page for a domain objects will show scalar fields for each of the object's *properties*, table grids for each of the object's *collections*, and buttons to represent the *actions*.
Properties and collections are the object's state, actions are the object's behaviour.
(This home page object has two properties, each of type `AsciiDoc`.
The `welcome` property - what you are reading now - is on the left, the `description` property on the right).
+
If running in prototype mode then there are a number of actions provided by the framework for development purposes; their label is in _italics_.

* At the bottom is a menu bar with credits, and to allow the user to *change theme*.

Click into the application and try things out.
