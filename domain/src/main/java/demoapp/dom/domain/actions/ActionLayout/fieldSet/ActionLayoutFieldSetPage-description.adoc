There are several annotations that influence the rendering of the various properties, collections and actions that make up a typical domain object:

* if an actions is associated with a property (using `@ActionLayout#associateWith`), then it will be rendered close to that property; by default below the property.

* if an action is associated with a collection (using either `@CollectionLayout#associateWith` or `@Collection#choicesFrom`), then again it will be rendered close to the collection (as part of the collection's table header).

* alternatively, an action can merely be associated with a fieldset.
This can be done either by link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/ActionLayout.html#fieldsetid[@ActionLayout#fieldSetId] (using the fieldset's id) and link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/ActionLayout.html#fieldsetname[@ActionLayout#fieldSetName] (using its name)

As an alternative to using annotations, you might also use the link:https://causeway.apache.org/userguide/2.0.0-RC1/fun/ui.html#by-example[.layout.xml] file.
One advantage of using the `.layout.xml` file is that changes can be picked up without having to restart the application.

It's even possible to combine the two approaches.
Some people use the `.layout.xml` file for the large-scale layout (rows, columns, fieldsets), and then use annotations to slot the properties, collections and actions into that larger-scale layout.


== How this demo works

This page object has two properties, each of which is in its own fieldset.
It also has two actions.
The actions are associated with the fieldsets, using either the fieldset id or name.

In terms of code:

* The `.layout.xml` file defines the fieldsets:
+
[source,xml]
.layout.xml
----
...
<cpt:fieldSet id="id" name="Identity">
    <cpt:property id="name"/>
</cpt:fieldSet>
<cpt:fieldSet id="detail" name="Detail">
    <cpt:property id="notes"/>
</cpt:fieldSet>
...
----

* one action is associated to a fieldset using the latter's `id`:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionLayoutFieldSetPage.java[tags=fieldsetId]
----
<.> maps to the fieldset using an `id`
<.> positioned on the fieldset's panel (the default is to position in the panel's dropdown)

* the other action is associated to a fieldset using the latter's `name`:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionLayoutFieldSetPage.java[tags=fieldsetName]
----
<.> maps to the fieldset using its `name`
<.> no position specified, so appears in the panel's dropdown.
