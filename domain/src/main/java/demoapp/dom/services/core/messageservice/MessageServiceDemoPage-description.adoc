Sometimes it's worth bringing something to the attention of the end-user.
The framework provides the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/services/message/MessageService.html[MessageService] which allows a message to be raised, at three levels of severity.
The Wicket viewer shows these messages as "toast" popups.

== How this demo works

Use the actions on the left hand side to raise a message at each of the three different levels of severity supported.

In terms of code:

* to raise an informational message:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.MessageServiceDemoPage.java
----
include::MessageServiceDemoPage.java[tags=informUser]
----

* to raise an warning:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.MessageServiceDemoPage.java
----
include::MessageServiceDemoPage.java[tags=warnUser]
----

* to raise an error message
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.MessageServiceDemoPage.java
----
include::MessageServiceDemoPage.java[tags=raiseError]
----
