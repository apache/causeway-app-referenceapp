The purpose of the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/DomainObjectLayout.html#describedas[@DomainObjectLayout#describedAs] is simply to provide a static description of the domain object.

== How this demo works

The collection on the left hand side shows a set of objects that have been annotated with `describedAs`.
Hover over the icons of the objects in the collection, and this text will be shown in (the bottom half of) each tooltip.

Navigate into any of the objects and the same text is shown when hovering over the object's title.

In terms of code:

[source,java,indent=0]
.DomainObjectLayoutDescribedAsEntity.java
----
include::DomainObjectLayoutDescribedAsEntity.java[tags=class]
----
<.> provides the description.
The viewer renders this in a tooltip.
