This domain class is used in the demo of `@PropertyLayout#hidden`.

== How this demo works

This entity defines four properties, and depending upon context, they may be visible on an object form or when rendered in a collection.

From this page, you can inspect the visibility of the actions from the context of an object form:

* `hidden` not specified:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyLayoutHidden.java[tags=none]
----
<.> property _should_ be visible for this entity on both object forms and collections.

* `hidden` on object forms, but not hidden in collections:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyLayoutHidden.java[tags=object-forms]
----
<.> property should _NOT_ be visible on this page

* `hidden` on collections:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyLayoutHidden.java[tags=all-tables]
----
<.> property _should_ be visible on this page.

* `hidden` everywhere:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyLayoutHidden.java[tags=everywhere]
----
<.> property should never be visible for this entity
