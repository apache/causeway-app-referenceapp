Mixins allow domain object behaviour to be encapsulated as a separate class.
This behaviour is then contributed to a target object as an action, property or collection.

Mixins contribute only behaviour, not state.
In the case of a contributed property or collection (that seemingly show state), these are in effect _derived_.
Behind the scenes a query is run against the contributee (or mixee) object.

The framework instantiates the mixin by injecting the contributee/mixee object into the mixin through its (1-arg) constructor.
All mixins that declare a constructor compatible with the mixee's type contribute to that mixee's metamodel; this includes interfaces.

== How this demo works

This page object shows examples of all three types of mixins: a mixin action, a mixin property and a mixin collection.

=== Mixin action

The page object itself has a single read-only property, `count`:

[source,java]
.MixinPage.java
----
include::MixinPage.java[tags=class]
----
<.> editing disabled; it will be modified through a mixin

It also implements an interface, `CountHolder`.

[source,java]
.CountHolder.java
----
include::CountHolder.java[tags=class]
----

A mixin action allows this to be modified.
The examples contribute to the following class, which holds a simple non-editable "count" integer property:

The `CountHolder_updateCount` mixin action contributes by way of this `CountHolder` interface:

[source,java]
.CountHolder_updateCount.java
----
include::CountHolder_updateCount.java[tags=class]
----
<.> indicates this class is a mixin action
<.> useful lombok annotation to generate the 1-arg constructor
<.> the contributee

The mixin class's name comes in two parts.
The convention is for the first part (before the "_") to be the type name, while the action id is the second part (after the "_", in other words "updateCount").


=== Contributed collection

The `CountHolder_fibonacciSequence` mixin collection dynamically computes the first N number of fibonacci numbers:

[source,java]
.CountHolder_fibonacciSequence.java
----
include::CountHolder_fibonacciSequence.java[tags=class]
----
<.> indicates this class is a mixin collection
<.> useful lombok annotation to generate the 1-arg constructor
<.> the contributee


=== Contributed property

The `CountHolder_explanation` mixin property simply provides an explanat what's going on:

[source,java]
.CountHolder_explanation.java
----
include::CountHolder_explanation.java[tags=class]
----
<.> indicates this class is a mixin property
<.> useful lombok annotation to generate the 1-arg constructor
<.> the contributee
