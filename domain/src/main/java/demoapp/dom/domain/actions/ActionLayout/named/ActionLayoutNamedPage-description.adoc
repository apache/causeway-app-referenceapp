Sometimes the desired name of an action coincides with a reserved Java keyword, for example "default" or "package".
You will therefore need to use some other method name to implement the action.

The link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/ActionLayout.html#named[@ActionLayout#named] attribute allows you to override the name (as used for rendering) from that derived from the action's method name).

This can also be used if you want the name to include characters such as spaces or punctuation characters.



== How this demo works

This page object has two properties and an associated action with each.
Both of these actions use `@ActionLayout#named`, for different reasons.

In terms of code:

* the "reset" action uses a reserved Java name of "default" in the user interface:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionLayoutNamedPage.java[tags=reset]
----
<.> specifies the name to use in the UI

* the "updateNotes" action has a name that includes an invalid character, "(":
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionLayoutNamedPage.java[tags=updateNotes]
----
<.> specifies the name to use in the UI.


== .layout.xml

Instead of using `@ActionLayout#named`, it is also possible to specify a name in the link:https://causeway.apache.org/userguide/2.0.0-RC1/fun/ui.html#by-example[.layout.xml] file:

[source,xml]
.Xxx.layout.xml
----
...
<action id="updateNotes">
    <named>Updates (changes) the notes property</named>
</action>
...
----

The main advantage of using the `.layout.xml` file is that changes can be picked up without having to restart the application.


== Alternatives

Where the `@ActionLayout#named` is being used to avoid a clash with a reserved keyword, an alternative option is to use a mixin action.

For example, a "package" action for the `Order` class could be implemented using an `Order_package` mixin action:


[source,java]
.Order_package.java
----
@Action
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class Order_package {

    private final Order order;

    public OrderPackage act(/*...*/) {
        // ...
    }
}
----
