This domain class has two mixins that both demonstrate the use of link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/DomainObject.html#mixinmethod[@DomainObject#mixinmethod] to override the default method names used by  link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/Property.html[@Property], link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/Collection.html[@Collection] or link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/Action.html[@Action]

The "initialCharacter" property mixin contributes a derived property:

[source,java,indent=0]
.DomainObjectMixinMethodEntity_initialCharacter.java
----
include::DomainObjectMixinMethodEntity_initialCharacter.java[tags=class]
----
<.> overrides the default mixin method
<.> method representing the contributed domain collection, using the overridden method name

Meanwhile the "updateName" action mixin allows the name to be changed for the domain object:

[source,java,indent=0]
.DomainObjectMixinMethodEntity_updateName.java
----
include::DomainObjectMixinMethodEntity_updateName.java[tags=class]
----
<.> overrides the default mixin method
<.> method representing the contributed domain collection, using the overridden method name
