Application Tenancy is the idea that certain information "belongs" to one party and should be either not visible or at least not modifiable by some other party.

The SecMan extension provides a very flexible way of implementing this, through the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/extensions/index/secman/applib/tenancy/spi/ApplicationTenancyEvaluator.html#section-top[ApplicationTenancyEvaluator] SPI.
This allows a domain service to decide whether to hide or to disable each object for the current user.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This SPI is a presentation-layer concern only.
It does not prevent the domain objects from being retrieved from the data store.
In particular, there is nothing to prevent "malicious" code from retrieving and interacting with objects from another tenancy.
====

== How this demo works

On the left hand side is a collection of objects, each with different names.
There are also two properties that control an implementation of `ApplicationTenancyEvaluator`.

* The "Hide Regex" determines which objects with a matching name should be hidden.
For example, "M.\*" will hide those whose name starting "M", while ".*" will hide them all.
* The "Disable Regex" determines which objects can no longer be modified (when you navigate into them).

In terms of code:

* the SPI implementation is:
+
[source,java]
.ApplicationTenancyEvaluatorForDemo.java
----
include::ApplicationTenancyEvaluatorForDemo.java[tags=class]
----
<.> implements the SPI.
There can be multiple implementations; all will be checked.
<.> whether this implementation handles the type of the domain object being considered.
<.> set by the page object
This demo application deals only with the `TenantedEntity` entity type.
<.> whether the current user can view the domain object.
<.> whether the current user can modify (invoke actions, edit the properties of) the domain object.

* the page object has actions that set a pattern on the service.

=== Leveraging User Tenancy

This demo implementation doesn't in fact use the current `ApplicationUser` at all.
A more realistic implementation would exploit the fact that `ApplicationUser` implements `HasAtPath` and therefore can return an `atPath`: the "application tenancy path":

[source,java]
----
public interface ApplicationUser extends HasAtPath {
    String getAtPath();
    //  ...
}
----

The `atPath` is just a string and can take any format and be processed in any way that makes sense.
One algorithm is to use it to define a hierarchy path, for example "/GBR/LON" represents a user based in London, Great Britain while "/ITA/MIL" is a user based in Milan, Italy.
If the domain object also implements `HasAtPath`, then the `ApplicationTenancyEvaluator` can compare the two ``atPath``s to determine if the location/tenancy of the user is should allow access to the location/tenancy of the domain object.
