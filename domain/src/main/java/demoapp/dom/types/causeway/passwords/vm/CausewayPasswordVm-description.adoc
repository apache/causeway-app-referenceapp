Because `Password` is specific to Apache Causeway, JAXB _cannot_ serialize it automatically, meaning that an implementation of `@XmlJavaTypeAdapter` is required.

The framework _does_ provide a simple *non-secure* implementation, but (unlike other value types) the `Password` class is not itself annotated with this implementation.
For the purposes of the demo, each of the properties is instead annotated with the non-secure annotation.

In a production application, though, you should provide your own implementation that can securely serialize/deserialize the state of the `Password` value (presumably by encrypting it first).

This is the default for JAXB so no additional annotation required.
