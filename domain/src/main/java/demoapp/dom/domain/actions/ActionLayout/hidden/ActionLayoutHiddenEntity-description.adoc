This domain class is used in the demo of `@ActionLayout#hidden`.

== How this demo works

This entity defines four actions, and depending upon context, they may be visible on an object form or when rendered in a collection.

From this page, you can inspect the visibility of the actions from the context of an object form:

* `hidden` not specified:
+
[source,java]
.ActionLayoutHiddenEntity_changeName
----
include::ActionLayoutHiddenEntity_changeName.java[tags=class]
----
<.> no `hidden` attribute specified, so implicitly visible

* `hidden` on object forms (but not necessarily on collections):
+
[source,java]
.ActionLayoutHiddenEntity_changeNameHiddenObjectForms.java
----
include::ActionLayoutHiddenEntity_changeNameHiddenObjectForms.java[tags=class]
----
<.> action should _NOT_ be visible for this entity.

* `hidden` on collections (but not necessarily on object forms):
+
[source,java]
.ActionLayoutHiddenEntity_changeNameHiddenAllTables.java
----
include::ActionLayoutHiddenEntity_changeNameHiddenAllTables.java[tags=class]
----
<.> action _should_ be visible for this entity.

* `hidden` everywhere:
+
[source,java]
.ActionLayoutHiddenEntity_changeNameHiddenEverywhere.java
----
include::ActionLayoutHiddenEntity_changeNameHiddenEverywhere.java[tags=class]
----
<.> action should _NOT_ be visible for this entity.
