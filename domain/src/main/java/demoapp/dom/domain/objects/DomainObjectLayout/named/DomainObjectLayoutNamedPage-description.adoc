The purpose of the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/DomainObjectLayout.html#named[@DomainObjectLayout#named] is to provide a different effective name for the domain class wherever it appears in the user interface, for example tooltips.

One reason to use this annotation is if the default name (derived from the physical class name) would expose implementation details that you might prefer to keep hidden.

Note that this does _not_ affect the bookmark, for example as used in the URL; for that, specify the logical type name using `@javax.inject.Named`.


== How this demo works

The collection on the left hand side shows a set of objects that have been annotated with `named`.
Hover over the icons of the objects in the collection, and the name will be shown in the (top half of) each tooltip.

Navigate into any of the objects and the name is shown when hovering over the object's title.

In terms of code:

[source,java,indent=0]
.DomainObjectLayoutNamedEntity.java
----
include::DomainObjectLayoutNamedEntity.java[tags=class]
----
<.> overrides the default name.
The viewer renders this name in a tooltip.
