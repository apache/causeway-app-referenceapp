The name of a collection is used as the label of the field in the UI.
Normally the name is inferred from the name of the corresponding field or getter method in code.
This inferred name can be however be overridden using either the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/CollectionLayout.html#named[@CollectionLayout#named] attribute, or using the link:https://causeway.apache.org/userguide/2.0.0-RC1/fun/ui.html#by-example[.layout.xml] layout file.

This is useful for example if you want the name to include characters such as spaces or punctuation characters.


== How this demo works

This page object has two collections, and both has had their name explicitly specified using each of the two mechanisms.

In terms of code:

* the `children` collection has its name specified using the `@CollectionLayout#named()` annotation:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::CollectionLayoutNamedPage.java[tags=children]
----
<.> explicitly specifies the name of the collection

* meanwhile, the `moreChildren` collection has its name specified using the `Xxx.layout.xml` file:
+
[source,xml,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
<cpt:collection id="moreChildren">
    <cpt:named>Named using layout.xml</cpt:named>
</cpt:collection>
----
+
One advantage of the layout file over the annotation is that the layout file is dynamic: it can be modified and the changes reloaded in a running application.
