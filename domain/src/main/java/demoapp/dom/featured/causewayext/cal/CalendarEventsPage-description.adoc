The framework has built-in support for modelling events on a calendar, using the `CalendarEvent` data type.
This is a editable composite type which is rendered as a HTML card.
It also integrates with the link:https://causeway.apache.org/vw/2.0.0-RC1/fullcalendar/about.html[FullCalendar] module; entities that implement the `CalendarEventable` interface (having a property of type `CalendarEvent`) will be rendered on a calendar.

These can be used either in entities or view models.

NOTE: This is an Apache Causeway specific data type.

== How this demo works

On the left hand side is a collection of entities that uses the `CalendarEvent` datatype.
There is also an action that opens a view model; this view model also uses the `CalendarEvent` datatype.

Navigate into the entity or view model to see the datatype used as a property, an action parameter and as a return type of collections, along with code samples.

=== Implementation Notes

The entity and view model types both implement some common interfaces:

* The `CausewayCalendarEventHolder` interface is used to contribute a number of mixins to both types:
+
[source,java]
----
include::holder/CausewayCalendarEventHolder.java[tags=class]
----

* The `CausewayCalendarEventHolder2` interface is used to demonstrate support for label positions using `@PropertyLayout(labelPosition=...)`.

Further details, along with the effect of this annotation, can be seen on the entity and view model object pages.
