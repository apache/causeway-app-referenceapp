If a collection contains many instances, then by default these are paged.
The link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/DomainObjectLayout.html#paged[@DomainObjectLayout#paged] is used to specify how many instances of the domain object should be shown for parented collections, ie those belonging to an object.
(It is also used for standalone collections -- those returned from an action invocation).

The default provided by `@DomainObject#paged` can be overridden on a case-by-case basis using link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/CollectionLayout.html#paged[@CollectionLayout#paged].

IMPORTANT: the paging that occurs is at the application-layer, not the database layer.
In other words, the framework resolves _all_ of the objects are meet the criteria, and then manages the paging.
There could therefore be performance/memory issues if too many objects are returned by the Kquery.

== How this demo works

This page object has two collections, with each having a custom value of `paged` of 5.
Accordingly, only 5 objects are shown per page.
The first uses the annotation, the second uses `.layout.xml`.

In terms of code:

* the `children` collection is annotated:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::CollectionLayoutPagedPage.java[tags=children]
----
<.> explicitly indicates only 5 instances per page

* meanwhile, the `moreChildren` collection uses the `Xxx.layout.xml` file:
+
[source,xml,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
<cpt:collection id="moreChildren" paged="5"/>
----
+
One advantage of the layout file over the annotation is that the layout file is dynamic: it can be modified and the changes reloaded in a running application.



== Related configuration property

To set the global default for `paged` of parented collections, use this configuration property:

[source,yaml]
.application.yaml
----
causeway:
  applib:
    annotation:
      collection-layout:
        paged: 15
----
