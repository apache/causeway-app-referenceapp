The link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/Action.html#restrictto[@Action#restrictTo] attribute specifies whether the action should be available only in prototype mode, or at all times.

Prototype actions are useful in the early stages of development, typically  make it easier to explore the domain objects and their relationships.
For example (when using a test database with a small amount of data), an action could return all instances of a domain object such as `Customer`.
Or, a prototype action could return a random instance of a Customer, for exploratory testing or demos.

Prototype mode can be activated in several ways, but one of the easiest is to set the `PROTOTYPING` environment variable to `true`:

[source,bash]
----
export PROTOTYPING=true
----


== How this demo works

This page is a view model that defines three actions, each of which defines a different `restrictTo` attribute:

* no annotation
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionRestrictToPage.java[tags=action-no-annotation]
----
<.> does not indicate any `restrictTo` attribute; will be available in both prototype and production mode

* explicitly restricted to prototype mode:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionRestrictToPage.java[tags=action-restrict-to-prototyping]
----
<.> available only in prototype mode

* without any restrictions:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionRestrictToPage.java[tags=action-restrict-to-no-restrictions]
----
<.> available in both prototype and production mode
