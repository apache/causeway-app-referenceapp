Apache Causeway implements the relevant JDO extension points to allow the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/value/Blob.html[Blob] type to be persisted.
To do so correctly, it requires that the column names for the three constituent parts of a `Blob` are specified using `@Column`:

== About this demo

On the left hand side of this page, four `Blob` properties are defined for a JDO entity, along with a variety of contributed properties and action.
The properties can variously be edited directly or through actions.

In terms of code:

* the entity class is:
+
[source,java]
----
include::CausewayBlobJdo.java[tags=class]
----

* the `readOnlyProperty` (mandatory) property is mapped using:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::CausewayBlobJdo.java[tags=property]
----

* while an optional property is mapped using:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::CausewayBlobJdo.java[tags=optional-property]
----

The remainder of this page describes the mixin actions and label placement for this datatype.
