The state of the application can be changed either by invoking actions on domain objects, or by directly editing their properties.

If the application has complicated business logic, then it's usually preferable to make all changes using actions, with editing globally disabled using a configuration property (see section below).
This demo application is configured in this recommended way, with property editing disabled by default.

However, the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/Property.html#editing[@Property#editing] annotation allows this to be overridden for a specific property.

It's also possible to override the default for a specific object, so that all of its properties using link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/DomainObject.html#editing[@DomainObject#editing].
There are therefore three levels at which property editing can be defined:

    global configuration property < @DomainObject < @Property

Alternatively, this works in the opposite direction also: if the global config property is to _allow_ properties to be edited, then the `@DomainObject#editing` (or `@Property#editing`) could be used to disable editing.
This would be much less common, though.

In addition, the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/Property.html#editingDisabledReason[@Property#editingDisabledReason] can be used to specify the reason why a property cannot be edited.
(This can also be specified at the object level using link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/DomainObject.html#editingDisabledReason[@DomainObject#editingDisabledReason].)


== How this demo works

The collection on the left shows a set of entity instances, which use `@Property#editing` to enable editing of one of their properties.
The "initialCharacter" property cannot be edited either, because it is a derived property (has only a getter).

You'll need to navigate through to the entity in order to edit its properties.

In terms of code:

* for the `name` property, editing has been explicitly enabled:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.PropertyEditingEntityImpl.java
----
include::jpa/PropertyEditingEntityImpl.java[tags=name]
----
<.> editing is enabled after all

* The `originalName` property remains as not editable.
+
It uses `@Property#editingDisabledReason` to explain why:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.PropertyEditingEntityImpl.java
----
include::jpa/PropertyEditingEntityImpl.java[tags=original-name]
----
<.> this reason is rendered in the UI as a tooltip

* Meanwhile the `initialCharacter` property is also not editable (this time, because it is derived) but has no additional annotations:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.PropertyEditingEntityImpl.java
----
include::jpa/PropertyEditingEntityImpl.java[tags=initial-character]
----



== Configuration Property

If the application has complicated business logic, then it's usually preferable to make all changes using actions, with editing globally disabled using a configuration property:

[source,yaml]
.application.yml
----
causeway:
  applib:
    annotation:
      domain-object:
        editing: false    # false | true
----
