It's common to lay out a domain objects' members using the `@ActionLayout#associateWith` attribute, which places an action's button close to a property or collection.
If there are more than one such action associated with an object, then the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/ActionLayout.html#sequence[@ActionLayout#sequence] attribute can additionally be used to specify the order of those action buttons.

The value of the `sequence` attribute is a string, interpreted as a Dewey-decimal value, meaning:

    "1" < "1.0" < "1.1" < "1.1.1" < "1.1.2" < "1.2" < "1.3" < "2"

== How this demo works

This page has a `name` property and a `children` collection, and then has a number of actions associated with these members.
In the case of the `name` property, its associated action are positioned in various locations (using `@ActionLayout#position`).

In all cases, the `@ActionLayout#sequence` is used to specify the order.
This order is chosen to be the opposite of the alphabetic ordering of the action's identifier (eg `updateNameSeqZ` is ordered before `updateNameSeqY`).

=== Positioned below property

There are three actions associated with the `name` property and positioned below:

* first:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.ActionLayoutSequencePage_updateNameSeqZ.java
----
include::ActionLayoutSequencePage_updateNameSeqZ.java[tags=class]
----
<.> associated with the `name` property
<.> rendered first in the UI

* second:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.ActionLayoutSequencePage_updateNameSeqY.java
----
include::ActionLayoutSequencePage_updateNameSeqY.java[tags=class]
----
<.> rendered second; "1" < "2"

* third:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.ActionLayoutSequencePage_updateNameSeqX.java
----
include::ActionLayoutSequencePage_updateNameSeqX.java[tags=class]
----
<.> rendered third; "2" < "3"

=== Positioned to the right of the property

There are two actions positioned to the right of the `name` property:

* first
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.ActionLayoutSequencePage_updateNamePositionedRightSeqY.java
----
include::ActionLayoutSequencePage_updateNamePositionedRightSeqY.java[tags=class]
----
<.> uses Dewey format
<.> positioned to the right

* second
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.ActionLayoutSequencePage_updateNamePositionedRightSeqX.java
----
include::ActionLayoutSequencePage_updateNamePositionedRightSeqX.java[tags=class]
----
<.> uses Dewey format; "1.2" < "1.2.1"

=== Positioned on panel

Two further actions positioned on the panel:

* first
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.ActionLayoutSequencePage_updateNamePositionedPanelSeqY.java
----
include::ActionLayoutSequencePage_updateNamePositionedPanelSeqY.java[tags=class]
----
<.> positioned on the panel

* second
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.ActionLayoutSequencePage_updateNamePositionedPanelSeqX.java
----
include::ActionLayoutSequencePage_updateNamePositionedPanelSeqX.java[tags=class]
----
<.> uses Dewey format, "1" < "1.0"

=== Positioned on panel drop-down

Finally there are two actions associated with `name` that are rendered on the panel drop-down:

* first
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.ActionLayoutSequencePage_updateNamePositionedPanelDropDownSeqY.java
----
include::ActionLayoutSequencePage_updateNamePositionedPanelDropDownSeqY.java[tags=class]
----
<.> position on the panel drop down

* second
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.ActionLayoutSequencePage_updateNamePositionedPanelDropDownSeqX.java
----
include::ActionLayoutSequencePage_updateNamePositionedPanelDropDownSeqX.java[tags=class]
----
<.> uses Dewey format; "1.0" < "1.1"

=== For Collection

There are also two actions associated with the `children` collection:

* first:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.ActionLayoutSequencePage_addChild.java
----
include::ActionLayoutSequencePage_addChild.java[tags=class]
----
<.> associated with the `children` collection

* second:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.ActionLayoutSequencePage_addChild.java
----
include::ActionLayoutSequencePage_removeChild.java[tags=class]
----

=== Top-level actions

Lastly there are two actions that are not associated with any object members.
Because of the presence of the "unreferencedActions" attribute in the `.layout.xml`, these are rendered at the top, by the object header:

[source,xml]
.layout.xml
----
...
<bs3:col span="10" unreferencedActions="true">
    <cpt:domainObject />
</bs3:col>
...
----

The top-level actions are:

* first:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.ActionLayoutSequencePage_noopSeqY.java
----
include::ActionLayoutSequencePage_noopSeqY.java[tags=class]
----
+
Note there is no "associateWith" attribute.

* second:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.ActionLayoutSequencePage_noopSeqX.java
----
include::ActionLayoutSequencePage_noopSeqX.java[tags=class]
----


== .layout.xml

Instead of using `@ActionLayout#associateWith` and `@ActionLayout#sequence`, it is also possible to specify a all of these semantics using the link:https://causeway.apache.org/userguide/2.0.0-RC1/fun/ui.html#by-example[.layout.xml] file.

The main advantage of using the `.layout.xml` file is that changes can be picked up without having to restart the application.

It is also possible to mix-and-match.
Some people like to use `.layout.xml` to position properties into fieldsets and collections into columns or tabs, but to use `@ActionLayout#associateWith` and `@ActionLayout#sequence` to associate those actions with the properties and collections.
