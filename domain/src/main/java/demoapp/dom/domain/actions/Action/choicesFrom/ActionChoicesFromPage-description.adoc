Actions parameters can be either value types or reference types (typically entities), and can be either single-valued (a scalar) or multi-valued (a list).
Scalar values can be entered directly, but references to entities must be selected by some mechanism or another.

Most often this selection is enabled using a supporting method for the action parameter in question: `choicesNXxx()`, `autoCompleteNXxx()`.
Or alternatively it can be enabled by annotating the referenced domain type: `@DomainObject#autoComplete` or `@DomainObject#bounded`.

In the case of multi-valued parameters, there is a further option, namely to annotate the action using link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/Action.html#choicesfrom[@Action#choicesFrom], where the "choicesFrom" indicates a collection of objects of the appropriate reference type.

The end-user can select the choices using checkboxes rendered with the collection.

TIP: Such actions are sometimes called "bulk" actions because they (can) act upon many objects at once.


== How this demo works

The collection on the left hand side shows a set of domain objects, along with a couple of actions that both accept a collection of said objects as one of their parameters.

You can check the checkbox against one or more objectsand then click the actions' button.
The selected objects will be defaulted, but all objects will be available to select in the drop-down list.

In terms of code:

* page object:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.ActionChoicesFromPage.java
----
include::ActionChoicesFromPage.java[tags=class]
----

* (contributed) collection of objects:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.ActionChoicesFromPage_objects.java
----
include::ActionChoicesFromPage_objects.java[tags=class]
----

* one of the actions
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.ActionChoicesFromPage_makeLowerCase.java
----
include::ActionChoicesFromPage_makeLowerCase.java[tags=class]
----
<.> The `choicesFrom` attribute causes checkboxes to be rendered for each of the objects in the "objects" collection.
+
It also means that no `choices0Act()` or `autoComplete0Act()` is required.
