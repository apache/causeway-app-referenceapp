When a collection of entities are rendered by the viewer, the table will by default have one column for every property that is not otherwise universally hidden (eg using `@Property(hidden = Where.ALL_TABLES`).

Sometimes though the columns to be shown will depend upon the context in which the entity is being interacted.
One common approach is to define a view model as a projection of the entity, and return a collection of that view model instead.
However, if the user wants to access the entity they must first navigate to the view model, and from their navigate to the backing entity instance that it wraps.
The purpose of the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/Property.html#projecting[@Property#projecting] attribute is to eliminate this extra hop.

The idea is that the `projecting` attribute is placed on the property of the view model that references the backing entity.
With this hint, the viewer instead renders links to the entity rather than the view model.
From the end-user's perspectice, they aren't aware that a view model is in use at all.

== How this demo works

This page contains a property of type view model, and also a collection whose element type is a view model.
The view model in turn has a backing entity.
The diagram below illustrates this:

// see diag.adoc
image::/demoapp/dom/annotDomain/Property/projecting/uml-class-diag.png[width=600px]

If you click on the icon for either the property or the children, you should be navigated to the entity directly.

In terms of code:

* the `PropertyPublishingPage` has:

** a property referencing a single child view model:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyProjectingPage.java[tags=property]
----

** a collection of child view model objects:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyProjectingPage.java[tags=children]
----

* Meanwhile the property from `PropertyPublishingChildVm` to `PropertyPublishingChildEntity` is annotated as a "projecting" property:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.PropertyProjectingChildVm.java
----
include::PropertyProjectingChildVm.java[tags=projecting]
----
<.> projecting property
<.> it is _not_ necessary for the property to be visible.
Indeed, it probably should not be visible as its presence might confuse the end-user who is interacting with the view model "as if" it is the entity.


[TIP]
====
As it isn't possible to access the projecting view model at all, there's no need to define a `layout.xml` file for the view model.
