Every domain type has a logical type name which is typically specified using `@javax.inject.Named` annotation.
The logical type name is used to construct https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/services/bookmark/Bookmark.html[Bookmark]s for domain objects, and is used to identify action invocations, for example as defined by the https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/schema/cmd.html[cmd] and https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/schema/ixn.html[ixn] schemas and in the callback methods of https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/services/publishing/spi/CommandSubscriber.html[CommandSubscriber] and https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/services/publishing/spi/ExecutionSubscriber.html[ExecutionSubscriber].

The logical type name is distinct from the physical Java class name so that the code itself can be refactored without breaking the above contracts.

Sometimes though there may be good reasons to change the logical type name.
Perhaps the domain class has to be moved from one module to another, and you would prefer that the logical type name reflects the module.

The purpose of the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/DomainObject.html#aliased[@DomainObject#aliased] attribute is to record additional logical type names, so that the main logical type name can be changed.

For example, suppose an `Customer` type initially is part of the "customer" module and its original logical type name is "customer.Customer".
Later on, you decide to move `Customer` to a more generic "party" module, with a new logical type name being "party.Customer".
However, any bookmarks in the old format of "customer.Customer:1234" should still resolve.

== How this demo works

The collection on the left shows a set of entity instances, each indicating their current bookmark and a previous bookmark that corresponds to the value of their link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/DomainObject.html#aliased[@DomainObject#alias].

The "lookup" (mixin) action uses the https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/services/bookmark/BookmarkService.html[BookmarkService] to lookup any object using either their current bookmark (defined by `@Named`) or their previous bookmark (defined by `@DomainObject#alias`).
For convenience, the action provides a choices method for all possible values.

In terms of code:

* the entity (subclass) is declared with `@DomainObject#aliased`.
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.DomainObjectAliasedEntityImpl.java
----
include::jpa/DomainObjectAliasedEntityImpl.java[tags=class]
----
<.> current logical type name
<.> previous logical type name.
The `previousBookmark` property (see below) calculates this

* the entity (superclass) exposes this metadata as regular properties:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.DomainObjectAliasedEntity.java
----
include::DomainObjectAliasedEntity.java[tags=class]
----

* the "lookup" mixin allows objects to be looked up using either a bookmark referencing the entity's current name, or its previous:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.DomainObjectAliasedPage_lookup.java
----
include::DomainObjectAliasedPage_lookup.java[tags=class]
----
<.> can lookup using actual bookmark ...
<.> \... or the previous bookmark (for which the class defines an alias)
