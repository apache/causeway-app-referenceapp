Often the end-user of your application will be a frequent user and will know by sight the purpose of the various properties, collections and actions that are displayed.
But, for less experienced users, or for new features, providing a description to provide brief additional information to the user may be of help.

The description of a collection can be specified using either the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/CollectionLayout.html#describedas[@CollectionLayout#describedAs] annotation, or a meta-annotation, or using the `Xxx.layout.xml` layout file.

In either case the description of the collection is used as the tooltip of the label in the UI, providing more information to the end-user.

== How this demo works

This page object has two collections, one of which has a description defined by the annotation, and the other using the `.layout.xml` file.
In both cases this description is rendered as a tooltip of the collection's label.

In terms of code:

* For the `children` collection, its description is specified using `@PropertyLayout#describedAs()`:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.CollectionLayoutDescribedAsPage.java
----
include::CollectionLayoutDescribedAsPage.java[tags=children]
----
<.> explicitly specifies the description of the collection

* For the `moreChildren` property, its description is specified using the `.layout.xml` file:
+
[source,xml,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
<cpt:collection id="moreChildren">
    <cpt:describedAs>This is a collection of more children (provided by the .layout.xml file)</cpt:describedAs>
</cpt:collection>
----
