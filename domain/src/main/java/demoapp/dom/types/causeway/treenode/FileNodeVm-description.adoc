The framework has built-in support for a `TreeNode` value type which represents a hierarchical data structure.

NOTE: This is an Apache Causeway specific data type.

== How this demo works

This demo app uses the filesystem of the host computer to illustrate the idea:

* This page you are viewing is a view model object, called `FileNodeVm`.
It represents either a directory or a file within that filesystem.

* Every instance of `FileNode` shows the same `TreeNode` instance, on the left hand side.
This is contributed by a mixin property, and is cached on HTTP session.
You can use this to navigate into the tree and inspect the individual files, without "losing your place".


//
// THE FOLLOWING DOESN'T ADD MUCHdoesn't add much:
//
// === Properties
//
// The properties of `FileNodeVm` are defined as:
//
// [source,java,indent=0]
// ----
// include::FileNodeVm.java[tags=properties]
// ----
//
//
// === Icon
//
// It's common for hierarchical objects to indicate their nature using an icon:
//
// [source,java,indent=0]
// ----
// include::FileNodeVm.java[tags=iconName]
// ----
//
// where `FileNodeType` is:
//
// [source,java,indent=0]
// ----
// include::FileNodeType.java[tags=class]
// ----
//
// Note that there are SVG files for each of the instances of this enum, namely `FileNodeVm-FILE_SYSTEM_ROOT.svg`, `FileNodeVm-DIRECTORY.svg` and `FileNodeVm-FILE.svg`.


=== Tree

As described above, every `FileNode` renders the same tree.
This is contributed by a mixin property:

[source,java,indent=0]
.FileNodeVm_tree.java
----
include::FileNodeVm_tree.java[tags=class]
----

The tree instance itself is cached by a `FileTreeNodeService`, so that there is no need to track the state of the tree (which nodes are expanded etc).
The `FileTreeNodeService` in turn uses `HttpSession` as the actual in-memory cache:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::FileTreeNodeService.java[tags=sessionTree]
----

The `TreeNode` value type itself is created using:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::FileTreeNodeService.java[tags=newTree]
----

This requires an implementation of the `TreeAdapter<T>` SPI, discussed next.

==== TreeAdapter SPI

To render a `TreeNode`, the application must provide an implementation of the `TreeAdapter<T>` SPI:

[source,java]
----
public interface TreeAdapter<T> {
    public Optional<T> parentOf(T value);
    public int childCountOf(T value);
    public Stream<T> childrenOf(T value);
}
----

In the case of the demo app, the implementation is `FileSystemTreeAdapter`, which navigate the host computer's filesystem:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::FileSystemTreeAdapter.java[tags=class]
----
