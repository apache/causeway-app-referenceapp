The framework emits 7 different lifecycle event for domain entities as they progress through their persistence lifecycle.

By default the framework will emit a default event type.
However, using link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/DomainObject.html[@DomainObject] the exact subtype can be overridden:

* link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/DomainObject.html#createdlifecycleevent[@DomainObject#createdLifecycleEvent] - when an entity is instantiated in memory (but not yet persisted).
Must be a subclass of https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/events/lifecycle/ObjectCreatedEvent[ObjectCreatedEvent].
+
CAUTION: The new-ed up entity must be passed to (or created via) either `FactoryService.detachedEntity(...)` or `RepositoryService.detachedEntity(...)` for the 'created' lifecycle event to be fired.

* link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/DomainObject.html#persistinglifecycleevent[@DomainObject#persistingLifecycleEvent] - when a newly instantiated entity is about to be INSERTed for the first time to the database.
Must be a subclass of https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/events/lifecycle/ObjectPersistingEvent[ObjectPersistingEvent].

* link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/DomainObject.html#persistinglifecycleevent[@DomainObject#persistingLifecycleEvent] - when a newly instantiated entity has just been INSERTed to the database for the first time.
Must be a subclass of https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/events/lifecycle/ObjectPersistedEvent[ObjectPersistedEvent].

* link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/DomainObject.html#loadedlifecycleevent[@DomainObject#loadedLifecycleEvent] - when a entity is retrieved from the database into memory.
Must be a subclass of https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/events/lifecycle/ObjectLoadedEvent[ObjectLoadedEvent].

* link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/DomainObject.html#updatinglifecycleevent[@DomainObject#updatingLifecycleEvent] - when an already-persisted entity is about to be UPDATEd in the database.
Must be a subclass of https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/events/lifecycle/ObjectUpdatingEvent[ObjectUpdatingEvent].

* link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/DomainObject.html#updatedlifecycleevent[@DomainObject#
updatedLifecycleEvent] - when an already-persisted entity has just been UPDATEd in the database.
Must be a subclass of https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/events/lifecycle/ObjectUpdatedEvent[ObjectUpdatedEvent].

* link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/DomainObject.html#removinlifecycleevent[@DomainObject#
removingLifecycleEvent] - when an already-persisted entity is about to be DELETEd from the database.
Must be a subclass of https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/events/lifecycle/ObjectRemovingEvent[ObjectRemovingEvent].

== How this demo works

The page provides actions to allow a single entity to be created, updated and deleted.
It also shows a list of events that are captured by a subscriber, for each of the corresponding lifecycle events.

In terms of code:

* the entity class defines a set of domain event classes:
+
[source,java]
.DomainObjectXxxLifecycleEvent.java
----
include::DomainObjectXxxLifecycleEventEntity.java[tags=class]
----
<.> specifies a custom event type for the "created" callback
<.> specifies a custom event type for the "persisting" callback
<.> specifies a custom event type for the "persisted" callback
<.> specifies a custom event type for the "updating" callback
<.> specifies a custom event type for the "updated" callback
<.> specifies a custom event type for the "removing" callback
<.> specifies a custom event type for the "loaded" callback
<.> interface that all event classes implemented.
Such an interface isn't mandatory, but it allows the subscriber (below) to subscribe to all events with a single callback.

* the subscriber subscribes to the common interface.
For all events, it simply constructs a view model and adds to a list:
+
[source,java]
.DomainObjectXxxLifecycleEventSubscriber.java
----
include::DomainObjectXxxLifecycleEventSubscriber.java[tags=class]
----
<.> for simplicity, listens to the common interface defined by all of the custom event types
<.> appends to an in-memory list

* the contributed `events` collection simply surfaces the list of events received by the subscriber:
+
[source,java]
.DomainObjectXxxLifecycleEventPage_events.java
----
include::DomainObjectXxxLifecycleEventPage_events.java[tags=class]
----

* finally there are actions to create, update and delete an entity.
There's nothing very remarkable about them:

** create:
+
[source,java]
.DomainObjectXxxLifecycleEventPage_createEntity.java
----
include::DomainObjectXxxLifecycleEventPage_createEntity.java[tags=class]
----

** update:
+
[source,java]
.DomainObjectXxxLifecycleEventPage_updateEntity.java
----
include::DomainObjectXxxLifecycleEventPage_updateEntity.java[tags=class]
----

** delete:
+
[source,java]
.DomainObjectXxxLifecycleEventPage_deleteEntity.java
----
include::DomainObjectXxxLifecycleEventPage_deleteEntity.java[tags=class]
----
