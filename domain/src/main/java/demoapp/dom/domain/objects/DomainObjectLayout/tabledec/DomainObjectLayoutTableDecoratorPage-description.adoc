The link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/CollectionLayout.html#tabledecorator[@CollectionLayout#tableDecorator] attribute can be used to specify a custom client side table renderer, for when a collection of domain objects is shown in either a parented collection (belonging to an object) or a standalone collection (returned from an action).

link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/DomainObjectLayout.html#tabledecorator[@DomainObjectLayout#tableDecorator]

NOTE: for parented collections, the `tableDecorator` value can be overridden on a case-by-case basis using link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/CollectionLayout.html#tabledecorator[@CollectionLayout#tableDecorator].

There is currently just one decorator available, for link:https://datatables.net/[datatables.net].
If specified, the effect of `@DomainObjectLayout#paged` and `@CollectionLayout#paged` are ignored.

== How this demo works

The collection on the left hand side shows a set of domain objects that have been annotated with `tableDecorator` which enables client-side rendering using link:https://datatables.net/[datatables.net].

The associated action "actionReturningCollection" returns these same objects as a standalone collection.

In terms of code:

* entity definition:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.DomainObjectLayoutTableDecoratorEntity.java
----
include::DomainObjectLayoutTableDecoratorEntity.java[tags=class]
----
<.> indicates that the link:https://datatables.net[datatables.net] decoration is used.


== Related configuration property

To set the global default for `tableDecorator`, use this configuration property:
