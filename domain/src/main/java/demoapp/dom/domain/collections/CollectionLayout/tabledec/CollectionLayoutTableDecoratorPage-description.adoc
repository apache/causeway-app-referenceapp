The https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/DomainObjectLayout.html#tabledecorator[@DomainObjectLayout#tableDecorator] can be used to define a custom client side table renderer for an object whenever it is shown in a collection, either parented or standalone.
The link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/CollectionLayout.html#tabledecorator[@CollectionLayout#tableDecorator] attribute can be used to override this for a specific renderer for a (parented) collection.

CAUTION: the `@CollectionLayout#tableDecorator` annotation currently has no effect; tracked by https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAUSEWAY-3482[CAUSEWAY-3482].
However, `@DomainObjectLayout#tableDecorator` _does_ work correctly.


There is currently just one decorator available, for link:https://datatables.net/[datatables.net].
If specified, the effect of `@CollectionLayout#paged` and `@DomainObjectLayout#paged` are ignored.

== How this demo works

The collection on the left hand side shows a set of domain objects that have been annotated with a `tableDecorator` which enables client-side rendering using link:https://datatables.net/[datatables.net].

In terms of code:

[source,java,indent=0]
.CollectionLayoutTableDecoratorPage.java
----
include::CollectionLayoutTableDecoratorPage.java[tags=children]
----
<.> indicates that the link:https://datatables.net[datatables.net] decoration is used.


== Related configuration property

To set the global default for all collections, use this configuration property:

[source,yaml]
.application.yaml
----
causeway:
  applib:
    annotation:
      collection-layout:
        table-decorator: ... #<.>
----
<.> `org.apache.causeway.applib.annotation.TableDecorator.Default` | `org.apache.causeway.applib.annotation.TableDecorator.DatatablesNet`
