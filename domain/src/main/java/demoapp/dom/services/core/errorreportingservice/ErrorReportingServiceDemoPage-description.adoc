Errors happen.

The framework does provide a default error handling implementation.
However, by implementing the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/services/error/ErrorReportingService.html[ErrorReportingService] SPI you may provide a more user-friendly experience:

== How this demo works

Hit the 'Trigger An Error' action to see what happens!

In terms of code:

* the SPI service is:
+
[source,java]
.ErrorReportingServiceForDemo.java
----
include::ErrorReportingServiceForDemo.java[tags=class]
----
<.> in a real-world system, this could be a lookup from an external system such as Jira, or might be an internally-generated identifier
<.> returns an implementation of link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/services/error/Ticket.html[Ticket], containing the details to be rendered to the end-user.
In this case we render a link to allow the end-user to create a mail using their mail client, if they so wish.

* the `EmailTicket` is:
+
[source,java]
.EmailTicket.java
----
include::EmailTicket.java[tags=class]
----
<.> If specified, is the external URL of an image to display to the end user.
(It doesn't have to be a kitten!)

* where `MailTo` captures the detail of where to mail to:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.EmailTicket.java
----
include::EmailTicket.java[tags=mailTo]
----
<.> the body message is truncated at the 1000th character in case of browser truncation

* and where on this occasion it also overrides `getMarkup()`, the actual HTML rendered:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.EmailTicket.java
----
include::EmailTicket.java[tags=markup]
----
