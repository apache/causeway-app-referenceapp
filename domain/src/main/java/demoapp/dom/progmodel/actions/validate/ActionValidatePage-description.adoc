There are often business rules which determine which action arguments are valid and which are invalid.
For example, it probably is invalid to specify a negative number of product items in an order, or to specify a date of birth in the future.

Using the "choices" or "autoComplete" supporting methods, it is sometimes possible to restrict the candidates only to those that are valid.
And the "default" supporting method can also provide a reasonable initial value (such as 1 item in an order).

Even so, when the action is invoked, it's necessary to make sure that all of the arguments provided are valid, both individually and in combination.

The purpose of the "validate" supporting method is to allow the action arguments to be checked before actually executing the action.
If this returns a non-null `String` (or for i18n, a non-null link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/services/i18n/TranslatableString.html#section[TranslatableString]), then a warning is shown and the action may not be executed.

There are several variations:

* the parameter argument being checked could be either a scalar or a collection
* the supporting "validate" method can be associated with the parameter by number, or by name
* the validation of a parameter might depend upon the value already selected for an earlier parameter.
** A single record-like structure can be defined and this can be passed through to all supporting methods instead.
** Or, the preceding N-1 parameters are supplied to the N^th^ "validate" supporting method.

Finally, there is also the "validate" supporting method for all of the arguments taken together.

== How this demo works

On the left hand side is a list of objects representing TV characters, also indicating the TV show that they appeared in.
Below is a list of selected characters, initially empty.

In the middle are a set of actions, each of which can be used to select a TV character or characters.
In some cases a property of the main page can be used to pre-select a value, in which case it will be used as the default for the action's parameter(s).
The last parameter of each action has a validation rule that must be satisified.

In terms of code:

* this action allows a single TV character to be selected.
It matches the supporting "choices" method with the parameter by number.
+
[source,java]
.ActionValidatePage_selectTvCharacterByShow.java
----
include::ActionValidatePage_selectTvCharacterByShow.java[tags=class]
----
<.> 0^th^ parameter has a supporting validation method to ensure that the selected argument appears in the TV show

* this action demonstrates dependent validation, using a "record" object to group together the preceding arguments.
+
[source,java]
.ActionValidatePage_selectTvCharactersByShowAndSexUsingRecord.java
----
include::ActionValidatePage_selectTvCharactersByShowAndSexUsingRecord.java[tags=class]
----
<.> the "tvCharacters" parameter argument is validated and so has a supporting "validate" method, associated by name.
<.> the "Parameters" record object groups together the preceding arguments, passed into the "validate" method
<.> the preceding parameter values are accessed and used for the validation.

* alternatively, this action implements the same behaviour but _without_ a "record" object, instead just passing through the N-1 arguments.
+
[source,java]
.ActionValidatePage_selectTvCharactersByShowAndSexUsingName.java
----
include::ActionValidatePage_selectTvCharactersByShowAndSexUsingName.java[tags=class]
----
<.> the "tvCharacters" parameter argument is validated and so has a supporting "validate" method, associated by name.
<.> the N-1 arguments are passed into the "validate" method and can be used for validation
<.> the argument actually being validated.

* the final example demonstrates validating _all_ of the arguments or an action together.
+
[source,java]
.ActionValidatePage_selectTvCharacters.java
----
include::ActionValidatePage_selectTvCharacters.java[tags=class]
----
<.> the set of parameters for the action method and the "validate" method are the same.
Note also that the "validate" method is named after the action, not after a parameter of the action.
<.> the validation accesses all of the parameters
