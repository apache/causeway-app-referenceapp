Domain classes fall into three broad categories:

* (singleton) domain services representing menus, eg whose actions are rendered in the menubars.
* domain entities, representing shared persistence state (eg `Customer`, `Order`, `Product` and so on)
* link:https://causeway.apache.org/userguide/${CAUSEWAY_VERSION}/fun/overview.html#view-models[view models], which hold session-specific (temporary) state.
View models can be used for a variety of use cases, such as a "manager" class to handle a complicated workflow (part of an "application layer"), or as an object to render as a simplified representation of an entity (part of the "presentation layer").
The object you are looking at right now is a view model.

Strictly speaking mixins are domain objects (with a `nature` of "MIXIN"), though they manifest as contributed domain members (properties, collections or actions) rather than as individual object instances in their own right.



== How this demo works

There are two collections on the left hand side, one of domain entities and the other of view models.
The entities are obtained by querying a repository, while the view models are created on the fly, each wrapping a corresponding entity.

In terms of code:

* collection of entities:
+
[source,java]
.DomainObjectNaturePage_entities.java
----
include::DomainObjectNaturePage_entities.java[tags=class]
----
+
where `DomainObjectNatureEntity` (JPA version) is defined as:
+
[source,java]
.DomainObjectNatureEntityImpl.java
----
include::entity/jpa/DomainObjectNatureEntityImpl.java[tags=class]
----
<.> The framework can infer the nature of the domain class from these annotations
<.> Nevertheless, it's generally good practice to specify the nature explicitly.


* collection of view models:
+
[source,java]
.DomainObjectNaturePage_viewModels.java
----
include::DomainObjectNaturePage_viewModels.java[tags=class]
----
<.> creates view model on the fly.

+
where `DomainObjectNatureViewModel` is defined as:
+
[source,java]
.DomainObjectNatureViewModel.java
----
include::viewmodel/DomainObjectNatureViewModel.java[tags=class]
----
<.> Specifies this is a JAXB element.
This is actually enough for the framework to infer that this domain object is a view model.
<.> Nevertheless, it's generally good practice to specify the nature explicitly.
<.> Required to reference a persistent entity (or the entity class itself can be so annotated).
