The `typicalLength` attribute is intended to indicate the size that a textfield should be rendered as a visual indicator of the expected length:

* for properties, the typical length can be specified using the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/PropertyLayout.html#typicallength[@PropertyLayout#typicalLength] attribute, or using the link:https://causeway.apache.org/userguide/2.0.0-RC1/fun/ui.html#by-example[.layout.xml] layout file.

* for parameters, the typical length can be specified using the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/PropertyLayout.html#typicallength[@ParameterLayout#typicalLength] annotation.

Note that link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/PropertyLayout.html#maxlength[@PropertyLayout#maxLength] and `@PropertyLayout#typicalLength()` are not related - the first prevents the property from holding more than the specified number of characters, the latter is a layout hint relating to the size of the textfield.

[CAUTION]
====
The Wicket viewer does not use this hint, instead preferring to render all textfields as the same size irrespective.
In other words, providing this hint has no impact on the UI (as rendered by the Wicket viewer, at least).

== How this demo works

This page has two editable properties, `name` and `notes`.
Both have the `typicalLength` attribute, using either an annotation or the `.layout.xml` file.
The `name` property can also be updated using an action, where the action parameter also specifies the typical length.

In terms of code:

* for the `name` property:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyLayoutTypicalLengthPage.java[tags=annotation]
----
<.> explicitly specifies the typical length

* for the action that updates the `name` property:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyLayoutTypicalLengthPage_updateName.java[tags=annotation]
----
<.> explicitly specifies the typical length

* for the `notes` property, the attribute is specified in the layout file:
+
[source,xml,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
<cpt:property id="notes" typicalLength="10"/>
----

+
One advantage of the layout file over the annotation is that the layout file is dynamic: it can be modified and the changes reloaded in a running application.
