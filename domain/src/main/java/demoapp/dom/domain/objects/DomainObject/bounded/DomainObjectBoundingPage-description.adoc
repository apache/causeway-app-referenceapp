If an action parameter is a reference type (typically an entity), then a mechanism is required to present a list of relevant existing instances for the end-user to select.

One means to do that is to write a supporting `choices` or `autoComplete` method for the action.
If the entity is "reference data" with a small, fixed set of instances, then a better option is to declare that the entity is bounded (as in "has a bounded set of instances").
This is done using link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/DomainObject.html#bounding[@DomainObject#bounding] attribute.

== How this demo works

The collection on the left shows a set of entity instances.
The "find" action allows any of these to be looked up from a drop-down.

In terms of code:

* the entity instance is annotated with `@DomainObject#bounding`:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.DomainObjectBoundingEntityImpl.java
----
include::jpa/DomainObjectBoundingEntityImpl.java[tags=class]
----
<.> indicates that there are a fixed (bounded) set of instances of this domain object.

* the "find" method simply returns the selected object:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.DomainObjectBoundingPage_find.java
----
include::jpa/DomainObjectBoundingPage_find.java[tags=class]
----
<.> just returns the provided object.
The main work is performed when the framework renders the action prompt, using the `bounding` attribute to determine how to obtain the objects to provide (in a drop-down list box).
+
Note that the class must be concrete.
