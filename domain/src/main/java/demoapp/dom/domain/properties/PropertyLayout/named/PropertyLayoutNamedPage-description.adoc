The name of a property or parameter is used as the label of the field in the UI.
Normally the name is inferred from the name of the corresponding field (or getter method) or parameter in code.
This inferred name can be however be overridden using various mechanisms with an explicit value:

* for properties, the name can be specified using the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/PropertyLayout.html#named[@PropertyLayout#named] attribute, or using the link:https://causeway.apache.org/userguide/2.0.0-RC1/fun/ui.html#by-example[.layout.xml] layout file.

* for parameters, the attribute can be specified using the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/PropertyLayout.html#named[@ParameterLayout#named] annotation.

This is useful for example if you want the name to include characters such as spaces or punctuation characters.


== How this demo works

This page object has two properties, and both has had their name explicitly specified using each of the two mechanisms.
The first also has an action whose parameter name has been explicitly set.

In terms of code:

* the `propertyUsingAnnotation` property, unsurprisingly, has its name specified using the `@PropertyLayout#named()` annotation:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyLayoutNamedPage.java[tags=annotation]
----
<.> explicitly specifies the name of the property

* the parameter of the action that updates it has _its_ parameter named using `@ParameterLayout#named()`:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyLayoutNamedPage_updateWithParameterLayout.java[tags=annotation]
----
<.> explicitly specifies the name of the parameter

* meanwhile, the `propertyUsingLayout` property has its name specified using the `Xxx.layout.xml` file:
+
[source,xml,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
<cpt:property id="propertyUsingLayout">
    <cpt:named>Named using layout.xml</cpt:named>
</cpt:property>
----

+
One advantage of the layout file over the annotation is that the layout file is dynamic: it can be modified and the changes reloaded in a running application.
