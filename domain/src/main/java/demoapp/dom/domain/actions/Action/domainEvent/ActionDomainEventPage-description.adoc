Usually a domain event is emitted by the framework to emit whenever the user interacts with an action.
Domain service subscribers can influence this interaction, either by:

* hiding the action
* disabling the action
* validating arguments of the action invocation
* performing arbitrary operations before the action has been invoked (including modifying the argument values to be used)
* performing arbitrary operations after the action has been invoked (including changing the apparent return value of the action)

The link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/Action.html#domainevent[@Action#actionDomainEvent] attribute specifies the class to be emitted; the class specified must be a subclass of the abstract link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/events/domain/ActionDomainEvent.html[ActionDomainEvent] class.

If no `domainEvent` is specified on the action itself, then the domain event class can be specified at the class level using link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/DomainObject.html#actiondomainevent[@DomainObject#actionDomainEvent].
And if not specified at the class level, then an instance of `o.a.c.applib.events.domain.ActionDomainEvent.Default` is emitted as the fallback.


== How this demo works

This page object has a single property, `text` and two (mixin) actions that update it.
One is annotated with a custom domain event, the other is not.

The annotated action can be controlled using the "change control strategy" action, influencing whether it is hidden, disabled, and so on.
This control does not apply to the non-annotated action.

In terms of code:

* the annotated action:
+
[source,java]
.ActionDomainEventPage_updateText.java
----
include::ActionDomainEventPage_updateText.java[tags=class]
----
<.> the event class to emit
<.> the event class definition.
It's common to define these as nested classes.

* the subscriber that listens to the events:
+
[source,java]
.ActionDomainEventControlSubscriber.java
----
include::ActionDomainEventControlSubscriber.java[tags=class]
----
<.> currently selected strategy
<.> listens to the custom event
<.> dispatches to the currently selected control strategy (see below)

* the action that selects the strategy in effect:
+
[source,java]
.ActionDomainEventPage_changeControlStrategy
----
include::ActionDomainEventPage_changeControlStrategy.java[tags=class]
----

* the different strategies:

** do nothing
+
[source,java]
----
include::ActionDomainEventControlStrategy.java[tags=class]
----

** hide
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionDomainEventControlStrategy.java[tags=hide]
----

** disable
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionDomainEventControlStrategy.java[tags=disable]
----

** validate
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionDomainEventControlStrategy.java[tags=validate]
----

** executing
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionDomainEventControlStrategy.java[tags=executing]
----

** executed
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionDomainEventControlStrategy.java[tags=executed]
----
