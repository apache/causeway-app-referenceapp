The link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/PropertyLayout.html#hidden[@PropertyLayout#hidden] attribute specifies whether a property should be visible in the UI or not, based on the context in which the object being rendered (within a form, i.e. on its own page, or within a collection)..

== How this demo works

The collection on the left hand side shows a set of domain objects.
That domain object defines four properties, and depending upon context, they may be visible on an object form or when rendered in a collection.
From this page, you can inspect the visibility of the actions from the context of a parented collection.

Navigate into each domain object to inspect the visibility of the actions on an object form.

The four properties are:

* `hidden` not specified:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyLayoutHidden.java[tags=none]
----
<.> property should be visible for this entity on both object forms and collections.

* `hidden` on object forms, but not hidden in collections:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyLayoutHidden.java[tags=object-forms]
----
<.> property _should_ be visible in the table

* `hidden` on collections:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyLayoutHidden.java[tags=all-tables]
----
<.> property should _NOT_ be visible in the table.

* `hidden` everywhere:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyLayoutHidden.java[tags=everywhere]
----
<.> property should never be visible for this entity

If you navigate into these domain objects then different properties will be visible due to the changed context.

[TIP]
.What is the difference between a hidden property and one annotated with `@Programmatic` ?
====
Although there is no difference in the UI, a hidden property _is_ part of the metadamodel while a link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/Programmatic.html#hidden[@Programmatic] property is not.

A rare (but valid) use case is to invoke such a hidden property using the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/services/wrapper/WrapperFactory.html#wrap(t,-synccontrol)[WrapperFactory] (skipping rules).
This can be for example to publish executions to any registered link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/services/publishing/spi/ExecutionSubscriber.html[ExecutionSubscriber]s.
