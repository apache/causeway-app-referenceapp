Entity change publishing allows the application to subscribe to events that indicate which entities have been created/updated/deleted, as provided by the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/${CAUSEWAY_VERSION}/applib/index/services/publishing/spi/EntityChangesSubscriber.html#spi[EntityChangesSubscriber] SPI.
The details are provided in the https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/${CAUSEWAY_VERSION}/schema/chg.html[ChangesDto], obtained from the  link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/${CAUSEWAY_VERSION}/applib/index/services/publishing/spi/EntityChanges.html[`EntityChanges`] parameter of the callback.
This callback is done only at the end of the interaction.

Common use cases are to replicate data to another system, or for gathering metrics ("which objects change the most?").
A typical SPI implementation could publish the event over the network, or perhaps store in a database.

Entity change publishing can be enabled or disabled globally using a configuration property (see section below).
This demo app has entity change publishing disabled by default, but can be re-enabled on a case by case basis using the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/DomainObject.html#entitychangepublishing[@DomainObject#entityChangePublishing] attribute.
This page references a domain object that uses this attribute.

NOTE: Publishing of domain objects is only supported for domain entities, not view models.



== How this demo works

The collection on the left shows a set of entity instances, which have `@DomainObject#entityChangePublishing` to enable the publishing of any changes to their state.
Below it is a collection that simply lists all of the changes that have been received.
This uses an implementation of `EntityChangesSubscriber` that captures changes and simply holds them in-memory.
(There will always be some listed from the fixture scripts that are run when the application bootstraps.)

Using the "modify" action, you can (in one go) create new instances of the entity class, update existing instances, or delete instances.
This will cause new events to be logged.


In terms of code:

* the entity class re-enables change publishing using `DomainObject#entityChangePublishing`:
+
[source,java]
----
include::jpa/DomainObjectEntityChangePublishingEntityImpl.java[tags=class]
----

* the modify action can be used to create new instances, update existing instances and/or delete existing instances:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::DomainObjectEntityChangePublishingPage_modify.java[tags=act]
----

* the subscriber listens to the events and simply adds them to the list:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.EntityChangesSubscriberToCaptureChangesInMemory.java
----
include::../../../_changes/EntityChangesSubscriberToCaptureChangesInMemory.java[tags=class]
----
<.> describes the set of changes

* the list of recent changes is shown because this page implementing an `ExposeCapturedChanges` marker interface (part of the demo app, not the framework).
A mixin then contributes the "recentChanges" collection:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.ExposeCapturedChanges_recentChanges.java
----
include::../../../_changes/ExposeCapturedChanges_recentChanges.java[tags=class]
----

== Configuration property

To enable/disable entity change publishing, use this configuration property:

[source,yaml]
.application.yml
----
causeway:
  applib:
    annotation:
      domain-object:
        entity-change-publishing: 'none'    # 'none' | 'all'
----
