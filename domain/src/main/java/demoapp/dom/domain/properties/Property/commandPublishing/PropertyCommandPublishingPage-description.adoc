Every _intention_ to edit a property is reified into a link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/services/command/Command.html[Command] which captures the target and the proposed property value, as well as the "who" and the "when" (identity of the user performing the action and a timestamp).

The link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/Property.html#commandpublishing[@Property#commandPublishing] determines whether subscribers are notified of the property being edited.

The link:https://causeway.apache.org/userguide/2.0.0-RC1/commandlog/about.html[commandLog] extension provides an out-of-the-box subscriber implementation that persists every published command into a log.
This can be invaluable for auditing and performance monitoring.

It is also possible to register additional subscribers for your own purposes.


== How this demo works

The collection on the left hand side shows a list of entities.
Those entities have two properties, `name` and `description`.
Both of these properties may be edited, but only the `name` property has command publishing enabled.

Editing the published property will result in a command representing the intention to edit the property being persisted.
The link:https://causeway.apache.org/userguide/2.0.0-RC1/commandlog/about.html[commandlog] extension persists these as link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/extensions/index/commandlog/applib/dom/CommandLogEntry.html[CommandLogEntry] entities.

To see this happening you will need to navigate into the entities and edit properties on the objects themselves.

In terms of code:

* property with command publishing enabled:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
..PropertyCommandPublishingEntity.java
----
include::PropertyCommandPublishingEntity.java[tags=published]
----
<.> makes the property editable...
<.> \... and enables command publishing



== Related configuration property

To set the global default for `commandPublishing`, use this configuration property:

[source,yaml]
.application.yaml
----
causeway:
  applib:
    annotation:
      property:
        command-publishing: "none"      # <.>
----
<.> either `none` or `all`
