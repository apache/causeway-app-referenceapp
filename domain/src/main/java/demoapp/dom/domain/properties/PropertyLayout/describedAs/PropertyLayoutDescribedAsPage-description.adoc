Often the end-user of your application will be a frequent user and will know by sight the purpose of the various properties, collections and actions that are displayed.
But, for less experienced users, or for new features, providing a description to provide brief additional information to the user may be of help.

* for properties, the description can be specified using either the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/PropertyLayout.html#describedas[@PropertyLayout#describedAs] annotation, or a meta-annotation, or using the `Xxx.layout.xml` layout file.

* for parameters, the description can be specified using either the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/ParameterLayout.html#describedas[@ParameterLayout#describedAs] annotation, or a meta-annotation.

In both cases the description of a property or parameter is used as the tooltip of the label in the UI, providing more information to the end-user.


NOTE: If the label is suppressed (using link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/PropertyLayout.html#labelposition[@PropertyLayout#labelPosition] set to `NONE`), then the description will not be shown either.


== How this demo works

This page object has three properties, `name`, `notes` and `address`.
Each of these has a description.
For `name` and `notes`, this description should be visible as a tooltip.
The `name` property also has a corresponding action to update it, whose parameter _also_ has a description (shown as a tooltip).

The `address` property is a counter-example though: even though it has a description, no tooltip is displayed.
See below for details as to why this is the case.

In terms of code:

* For the `name` property:

** its description is specified using `@PropertyLayout#describedAs()`:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyLayoutDescribedAsPage.java[tags=annotation]
----
<.> explicitly specifies the description of the property

* and it can be updated by an action whose (single) parameter is annotated with `@ParameterLayout#describedAs`:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.PropertyLayoutDescribedAsPage_updateName.java
----
include::PropertyLayoutDescribedAsPage_updateName.java[tags=annotation]
----
<.> explicitly specifies the description of the parameter

* For the `notes` property, its description is specified using the `.layout.xml` file:
+
[source,xml,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
<cpt:property id="notes">
    <cpt:describedAs>Notes about this object</cpt:describedAs>
</cpt:property>
----

* The `address` property is a counter-example: even though it has a description, it will not be rendered because it _also_ has a `labelPosition` which results in the label being suppressed:
+
[source,java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
include::PropertyLayoutDescribedAsPage.java[tags=label-position]
----
<.> A labelPosition of `NONE` suppresses the label and therefore also the description tooltip.
