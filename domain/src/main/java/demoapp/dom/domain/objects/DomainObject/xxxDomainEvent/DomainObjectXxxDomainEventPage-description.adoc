Usually a domain event is emitted by the framework to emit whenever the user interacts with an object member, in other words an action, property or collection.
Domain service subscribers can influence this interaction, either by:

* hiding the action, property or collection
* disabling the action or property.
(This does not apply to collections as they cannot be modified directly).
* validating arguments of the action invocation or property edit
* performing arbitrary operations before the action has been invoked / property edited (including modifying the argument values to be used)
* performing arbitrary operations after the action has been invoked / property edited (including changing the apparent return value of the action)

Most commonly the domain event to emit is specified at the member level, using link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/Action.html#domainevent[@Action#actionDomainEvent], link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/Property.html#domainevent[@Property#actionDomainEvent] or link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/Collection.html#domainevent[@Collection#actionDomainEvent].
But as a fallback the `domainEvent` can also be at the class level using link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/DomainObject.html#actiondomainevent[@DomainObject#actionDomainEvent].


== How this demo works

This page object has a single (editable) property, `text`, actions to update it, and a collection.
None of these domain members are annotated with a domainEvent directly, but the containing page object class _is_ annotated.

NOTE: normally we would position the actions alongside the property to which they are associated.
This demo deliberately does not (and leaves them near the page title), so that their behaviour (in particular, their visibility) can be checked independently of the property's behaviour.

The page object also has a control strategy property and corresponding action.
This is used to control interactions with the other members of the page: whether they are hidden, disabled, and so on.

In terms of code:

* this page object defines a set of domain event classes:
+
[source,java]
.DomainObjectXxxDomainEventPage.java
----
include::DomainObjectXxxDomainEventPage.java[tags=class]
----
<.> the action domain event class to emit (if not annotated at the member level)
<.> the property domain event class to emit (if not annotated at the member level)
<.> the collection domain event class to emit (if not annotated at the member level)
<.> marker interface.
All the domain event classes implement this interface, and the subscriber (see below) subscribes on this type.
<.> the property can be edited directly
<.> the property can also be edited by this action.
The property can also be edited via a mixin action (see next)

* the mixin action to update the property:
+
[source,java]
.DomainObjectXxxDomainEventPage_updateText.java
----
include::DomainObjectXxxDomainEventPage_updateTextViaMixin.java[tags=class]
----


* the subscriber that listens to the events:
+
[source,java]
.DomainObjectXxxDomainEventControlSubscriber.java
----
include::DomainObjectXxxDomainEventControlSubscriber.java[tags=class]
----
<.> currently selected strategy
<.> listens to the custom event (marker interface)
<.> dispatches to the currently selected control strategy (see below)

* the action that selects the strategy in effect:
+
[source,java]
.DomainObjectXxxDomainEventPage_changeControlStrategy
----
include::DomainObjectXxxDomainEventPage_changeControlStrategy.java[tags=class]
----
<.> Emits its own domain event just so that it won't hide itself (!)

* the different strategies:

** do nothing
+
[source,java]
----
include::DomainObjectXxxDomainEventControlStrategy.java[tags=class]
----

** hide
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::DomainObjectXxxDomainEventControlStrategy.java[tags=hide]
----

** disable
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::DomainObjectXxxDomainEventControlStrategy.java[tags=disable]
----

** validate
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::DomainObjectXxxDomainEventControlStrategy.java[tags=validate]
----

** executing
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::DomainObjectXxxDomainEventControlStrategy.java[tags=executing]
----

** executed
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::DomainObjectXxxDomainEventControlStrategy.java[tags=executed]
