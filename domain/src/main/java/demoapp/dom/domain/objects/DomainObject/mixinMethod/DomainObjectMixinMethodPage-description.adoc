Mixins are a mechanism for decoupling behaviour from state, so that the behaviour of the mixin seemingly belongs to an underlying domain object, but in fact is implemented in a different class.
This is a particularly powerful capability for large "modular monoliths", because the mixin can reside in one module and the mixee (or contributee) can reside in another.
This is made even more powerful by the fact that the mixin can contribute by way of an interface implemented by the contributee, rather than the contributee's concrete class.

TIP: learn more about mixins at `Prog Model > Mixins`.

The idiomatic way of writing mixins is as class that is annotated with link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/Property.html[@Property], link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/Collection.html[@Collection] or link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/Action.html[@Action].
These require that the mixin class has a single primary method representing the domain member being contributed.
By default the name of this method is "prop" for properties, "coll" for collections, and "act" for actions.
This default is defined through the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/DomainObject.html#mixinmethod[@DomainObject#mixinMethod]; if you look into their definition you will see that the `@Property,` `@Collection` and `@Action` are all meta-annotated with `@DomainObject#mixinMethod`.

In most circumstances there will be little need to use `@DomainObject#mixinMethod` directly.
However, if you prefer some other method names other than the defaults then you can annotate your mixins with this annotation; or define your own annotation (eg `@MyAction`) and meta-annotate it with both `@Action` and `@DomainObject#mixinMethod` as appropriate.


== How this demo works

The collection on the left is a mixin to this view model, the "updateName" is a mixin action allows the name of any object to be updated, and the "initialCharacter" is a mixin property.
These each uses `@DomainObject#mixinMethod` to change the default method name.

In terms of code:

* the mixin collection changes the default method name from "coll" to "collection".
It is defined as:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.DomainObjectMixinMethodPage_objects.java
----
include::DomainObjectMixinMethodPage_objects.java[tags=class]
----
<.> overrides the default mixin method
<.> method representing the contributed domain collection, using the overridden method name

* the "updateName" mixin action (shown on the collection panel) overrrides the default name from "act" to "action":
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.DomainObjectMixinMethodPage_updateName.java
----
include::DomainObjectMixinMethodPage_updateName.java[tags=class]
----
<.> overrides the default mixin method
<.> method representing the contributed domain collection, using the overridden method name

* the entity's 'initialCharacter' property mixin (shown as a column in the table is also a mixin) overrides the default name from "prop" to "property":
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.DomainObjectMixinMethodEntity_initialCharacter.java
----
include::DomainObjectMixinMethodEntity_initialCharacter.java[tags=class]
----
<.> overrides the default mixin method
<.> method representing the contributed domain collection, using the overridden method name
