The framework has built-in support for representing servlets and other resources that exist alongside the Apache Causeway runtime, using the `LocalResourcePath` data type.
When an action returns an instance of this type, then this is rendered as a redirect request to the browser to that resource.
In this way you could for example return a link to a PDF or image (to be rendered by the web browser itself), or provide access to dynamic content by redirecting to a servlet.

These can be used either in entities or view models.

NOTE: This is an Apache Causeway specific data type.

== How this demo works

On the left hand side is a collection of entities that uses the `LocalResourcePath` datatype.
There is also an action that opens a view model; this view model also uses the `LocalResourcePath` datatype.

Navigate into the entity or view model to see the datatype used as a property, an action parameter and as a return type of collections, along with code samples.

=== Implementation Notes

The entity and view model types both implement some common interfaces:

* The `CausewayLocalResourcePathHolder` interface is used to contribute a number of mixins to both types:
+
[source,java]
----
include::holder/CausewayLocalResourcePathHolder.java[tags=class]
----

* The `CausewayLocalResourcePathHolder2` interface is used to demonstrate support for label positions using `@PropertyLayout(labelPosition=...)`.

Further details, along with the effect of this annotation, can be seen on the entity and view model object pages.
