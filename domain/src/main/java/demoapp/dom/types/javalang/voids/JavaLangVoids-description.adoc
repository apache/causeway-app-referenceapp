Actions can return `void` or `java.lang.Void`.

When invoked, the framework will navigate to an empty page.

== How this demo works

On the left hand side are two actions, each of which returns void.

In terms of code:

* The `returnsVoid` action is simply:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::JavaLangVoids.java[tags=returnsVoid]
----

* The `returnsJavaLangVoid` action is simply:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::JavaLangVoids.java[tags=returnsJavaLangVoid]
----
