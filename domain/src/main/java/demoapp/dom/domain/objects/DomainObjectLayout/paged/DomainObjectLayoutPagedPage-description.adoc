If a collection contains many instances, then by default these are paged.
The link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/DomainObjectLayout.html#paged[@DomainObjectLayout#paged] is used to specify how many instances of the domain object should be shown for both parented collections (those belonging to an object) and standalone collections (those returned from an action invocation).

NOTE: for parented collections, the `paged` value can be overridden on a case-by-case basis using link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/CollectionLayout.html#paged[@CollectionLayout#paged].




== How this demo works

The collection on the left hand side shows a set of objects that have been annotated with `paged` of 5.`
Accordingly, only 5 objects are shown per page.

The associated action "actionReturningCollection" returns these same objects as a standalone collection.
Here again the `paged` value _is_ honoured.

In terms of code:

* entity definition:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::DomainObjectLayoutPagedEntity.java[tags=class]
----
<.> indicates that collections of this domain class should have no more than 5 objects per page.

== Related configuration property

To set the global default for `paged`, use this configuration property:

[source,yaml]
.application.yaml
----
causeway:
  applib:
    annotation:
      domain-object-layout:
        paged: 15
----
