The link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/DomainObjectLayout.html#sequence[@DomainObjectLayout#sequence] attribute provides a way to specify the order in which collections should be rendered in the user interface when their position has not been specified explicitly in the link:https://causeway.apache.org/userguide/2.0.0-RC1/fun/ui.html#by-example[.layout.xml] layout file.

TIP: It's more common to just use link:https://causeway.apache.org/userguide/2.0.0-RC1/fun/ui.html#by-example[.layout.xml] to specify the positioning of collections in the UI, which means that the `sequence` attribute is little used in practice.

== How this demo works

This page object defines three collections, `children`, `moreChildren` and `yetMoreChildren`.
However, none of these is referenced in the `.layout.xml` file, which means that they will all be rendered in the "unreferencedCollections" column.

The `sequence` attribute determines the order in which they appear in that column.

In terms of code:

* the `.layout.xml` defines the "unreferencedCollections" to the left hand side:
+
[source,xml,indent=0,tabsize=4]
.CollectionLayoutSequencePage.layout.xml
----
<bs3:grid ...>
    ...
	<bs3:row>
		<bs3:col span="6">
            ...
			<bs3:row>
				<bs3:col span="12" unreferencedCollections="true"/>
            </bs3:row>
        </bs3:col>
		<bs3:col span="6">
            ...
		</bs3:col>
	</bs3:row>
</bs3:grid>
----

* the three collections are annotated so that `moreChildren` is first, then `yetMoreChildren`, and finally `children`:
+
    "1" < "1.5" < "2"

** `children` has sequence of "2", so is rendered at the last (at the bottom):
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::CollectionLayoutSequencePage.java[tags=children]
----
<.> sequence of "2"

** `moreChildren` has a sequence of "1", so is rendered first:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::CollectionLayoutSequencePage.java[tags=more-children]
----
<.> sequence of "1"

** `yetMoreChildren` has a sequence of "1.5", so is rendered in-between.
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::CollectionLayoutSequencePage.java[tags=yet-more-children]
----
<.> sequence of "1.5"
