We use the term "parented collection" for a collection of objects that is "owned" by another object, for example the collection of ``OrderItem``s held by an `Order`.
Such collections when declared are usually parameterized, for example `Set<OrderItem>`.
The framework uses the generic parameter to ensure that the collection is rendered appropriately for that element type.

In some rare scenarios though it may be necessary to return only a raw (non-parameterized) collection type (eg `Set` or `List`).
In these cases the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/Collection.html#typeof[@Collection#typeOf] attribute can be used to indicate the element type of the returned collection.

== How this demo works

This page object defines two collections, both of which use a raw collection type.
The `children` collection is annotated with `@Collection#typeOf`, and so the framework is able to show the columns of the children.
However, the `otherChildren` collection has no such annotation, meaning that the framework knows only that it is a collection of ``Object``s.
No columns are shown, only an icon.

In terms of code:

* the `children` collection is annotated:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::CollectionTypeOfPage.java[tags=class-collections-children]
----
<.> hint as to the element type.
This results in columns in the table.
<.> the fact that this is a raw collection type does not matter, because of the annotation

* the `otherChildren` collection is not annotated:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::CollectionTypeOfPage.java[tags=class-collections-other-children]
----
<.> no hint as to the element type.
<.> also a raw collection type.
+
As a result, the framework has no information as to the type of element in the collection, and therefore can show only the object icons, no columns.
