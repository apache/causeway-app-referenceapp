Regular expressions are a common and powerful way to specify the format or structure of a string.
The link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/Property.html#regexpattern[@Property#regexPattern] attribute specifies a regular expression that the value entered into the property must match:

* for properties, the attribute can be specified using the `@Property` annotation

* for parameters, the attribute can be specified using the `@Parameter` annotation

This semantic applies only to strings.

== How this demo works

This page has an `emailAddress` property that can be edited directly, and also updated using an associated action.
Both the property and the action's parameter are annotated with the `regexPattern`, to ensure that the entered value meets a regex representing (a simplified definition of) an email address.

In terms of code:

* To edit the property directly:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyRegexPatternPage.java[tags=annotation]
----
<.> the regex pattern to be met
<.> the error message to display if the pattern is not met
<.> flags that modify how the pattern is matched.
These flags are as defined by link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#compile(java.lang.String,int)[java.util.regex.Pattern.compile(java.lang.String, int)]
<.> displayed as a tooltip

* To edit the property using an action::
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.PropertyRegexPatternPage_updateEmailAddress.java
----
include::PropertyRegexPatternPage_updateEmailAddress.java[tags=annotation]
----
<.> explicitly specifies that the property must match the regex pattern
