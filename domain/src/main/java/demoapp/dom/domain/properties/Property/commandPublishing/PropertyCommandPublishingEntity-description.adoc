This domain class is used in the demo of `@Property#commandPublishing`.

== How this demo works

This entity has two editable properties, `name` and `notes`.
One `name` property has command publishing enabled, while the `notes` property does not.

Editing the `name` property will result in a command representing the _intention_ to edit the property being persisted as a `CommandLogEntry`; these are listed in the collection at the bottom of the page.

In terms of code:

* property with command publishing enabled:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
..PropertyCommandPublishingEntity.java
----
include::PropertyCommandPublishingEntity.java[tags=published]
----
<.> makes the property editable...
<.> \... and enables command publishing

* property with command publishing disabled:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
..PropertyCommandPublishingEntity.java
----
include::PropertyCommandPublishingEntity.java[tags=not-published]
----
<.> makes the property editable...
<.> \... but command publishing is disabled

* contributed collection showing persisted ``CommandLogEntry``s:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.PropertyCommandPublishingEntity_publishedCommands.java
----
include::PropertyCommandPublishingEntity_publishedCommands.java[tags=class]
----
<.> repository provided by the _commandLog_ extension.
