Tooltips appear in the UI for two different reasons:

* to describe the purpose of an action, property or collection
* to explain why an action or property cannot be invoked/edited.

The former corresponds to the `describedAs` attribute (link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/ActionLayout.html#describedAs[@ActionLayout], link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/PropertyLayout.html#describedAs[PropertyLayout], link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/ParameterLayout.html#describedAs[@ParameterLayout], link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/CollectionLayout.html#describedAs[@CollectionLayout] or link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/DomainObjectLayout.html#describedAs[@DomainObjectLayout]), while the latter typically corresponds to the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib-methods/prefixes/disable.html[disable...()] supporting method (though there are other ways in which a veto might occur).

== How this demo works

This demo shows examples of each of the members with a tooltip (implemented using `#describedAs`), and it also includes examples of disabled actions or properties.

In terms of code:

* For actions, where there is both a description but is also disabled, then the disabled reason is used for the tooltip:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.TooltipPage.java
----
include::TooltipPage.java[tags=disabledAction]
----
<.> Action description is _not_ shown as a tooltip, because ...
<.> \... instead, the veto reason takes precedence

* For disabled properties that have a tooltip, both are shown; the tooltip from the label, while the disabled reason from the disabled icon after the value:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.TooltipPage.java
----
include::TooltipPage.java[tags=disabledProperty]
----
<.> The veto reason is shown a tooltip on an icon next to the property value ...
<.> \... but the property description is still shown, as a tooltip on the label
