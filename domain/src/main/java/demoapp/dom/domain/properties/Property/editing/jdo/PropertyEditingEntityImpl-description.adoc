In this demo app, property editing is disabled by default.

However:

* for the `name` property, editing has been explicitly enabled:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.PropertyEditingEntityImpl.java
----
include::PropertyEditingEntityImpl.java[tags=name]
----
<.> editing is enabled after all

* The `originalName` property remains as not editable.
+
It uses `@Property#editingDisabledReason` to explain why:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.PropertyEditingEntityImpl.java
----
include::PropertyEditingEntityImpl.java[tags=original-name]
----
<.> this reason is rendered in the UI as a tooltip

* Meanwhile the `initialCharacter` property is also not editable (this time, because it is derived) but has no additional annotations:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.PropertyEditingEntityImpl.java
----
include::PropertyEditingEntityImpl.java[tags=initial-character]
----
