This domain class is used in the demo of `@ActionLayout#redirectPolicy` (in combination with `@PropertyLayout#repainting`.

== How this demo works

This entity has a property holding an immutable PDF blob, and which is annotated with `@PropertyLayout#repainting` to suppress unnecessary repainting.
There are also two mixin actions that are used to increment its counter, both of which return the same entity.
One of these actions uses `@ActionLayout#redirectPolicy` to only update the page and so not redraw the PDF.
