We use the term "standalone collection" for a list or a set that is returned from an action.
Such collection are usually parameterized, for example, returning `List<Customer>` or `List<Order>`.
The framework uses the generic parameter to ensure that the list is rendered appropriately for that element type.

In some rare scenarios though it may be necessary to return only a raw (non-parameterized) collection type (eg `List` or `Set`).
In these cases the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/Action.html#typeof[@Action#typeOf] attribute can be used to indicate the element type of the returned collection.

== How this demo works

On the left hand side is a collection of entities that each have several properties.
There are also three actions that can be used to find a subset of these entities; they all return a standalone collection.
The three actions vary in how (or whether) they specify the element type of the returned collection.

In terms of code:

* the page object defines the `cihldren` collection:
+
[source,java]
----
include::ActionTypeOfPage.java[tags=class-collections-children]
----

* the `find` action uses a generic parameter list.
This is the preferred approach:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionTypeOfPage.java[tags=action-returning-generic-list]
----
<.> indicates the type of element in the returned list
+
The standalone list returned shows columns for the properties of the element type.

* the `findReturningRawList` action has the same functionality, but is defined to return a raw list:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionTypeOfPage.java[tags=action-returning-raw-list]
----
<.> action defines a raw list
+
Because this action effectively is returning only a `List<Object>`, the resultant table shows only icons for the matching elements; there are no columns shown for its properties.

* finally the `findReturningRawListButAnnotated` action also return a raw list, but is also annotated using `@Action#typeOf`:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionTypeOfPage.java[tags=action-returning-raw-list-but-annotated]
----
<.> indicates the type of element in the returned list
<.> action defines a raw list
+
The standalone list returned by this object should show the full details of the child object.
