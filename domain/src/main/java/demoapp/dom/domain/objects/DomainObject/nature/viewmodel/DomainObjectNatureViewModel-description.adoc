This object is a view model that "wraps" an underlying entity.

<.> Specifies this is a JAXB element.
This is actually enough for the framework to infer that this domain object is a view model.
<.> Nevertheless, it's generally good practice to specify the nature explicitly.
<.> Required to reference a persistent entity (or the entity class itself can be so annotated).

In many cases the framework is able to infer the nature of the domain object from annotations such as `@Entity` or `@PersistenceCapable` (for JPA or JDO entities), or from `@XmlElement` for JAXB-style view models.
The purpose of link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/DomainObject.html#nature[@DomainObject#nature] is to make the nature explicit.

[TIP]
.Long URLs
====
As you might have noticed, view models are often represented by long URLs.
This is because their state is encoded into that URL.

If the URL is too long, or if it holds sensitive data that needs to be encrypted, then the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/${CAUSEWAY_VERSION}/applib-svc/UrlEncodingService.html[UrlEncodingService] SPI allows different serializations to be provided.
