When an action is associated with a property (using `@Action#associateWith`) then by default its button will be rendered in the UI underneath the property's field.

The link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/ActionLayout.html#position[@ActionLayout#position] provides finer-grained control, allowing the button to be placed in one of four locations:

* underneath the property's field (the default position)

* alongside the property's field, as a drop-down

* on the panel (also known as the _fieldset_) containing the property

* as a drop-down of the panel containing the property.

== How this demo works

This demo page defines two properties, each with four corresponding mixin actions that simply update the property.
However, the actions are positioned in the four different location.

For the first property, `name`, the position of its mixin actions are specified using `@Action#associateWith`:

* positioned _below_:
+
[source,java]
----
include::ActionLayoutPositionPage_updateNotesPositionedBelow.java[tags=class]
----

* positioned _right_:
+
[source,java]
----
include::ActionLayoutPositionPage_updateNotesPositionedRight.java[tags=class]
----

* positioned on _panel_:
+
[source,java]
----
include::ActionLayoutPositionPage_updateNotesPositionedPanel.java[tags=class]
----

* positioned on _panel in drop-down_:
+
[source,java]
----
include::ActionLayoutPositionPage_updateNotesPositionedPanelDropDown.java[tags=class]
----

For the second property, `notes`, its location and the position of its mixin actions are specified using the link:https://causeway.apache.org/userguide/2.0.0-RC1/fun/ui.html#by-example[.layout.xml]:
