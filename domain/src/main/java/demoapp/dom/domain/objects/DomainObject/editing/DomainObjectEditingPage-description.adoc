The state of the application can be changed either by invoking actions on domain objects, or by directly editing their properties.
If the application has complicated business logic, then it's usually preferable to make all changes using actions, with editing globally disabled using a configuration property (see section below for details).
This demo application is configured in this recommended way, with property editing disabled by default.

The link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/DomainObject.html#editing[@DomainObject#editing] annotation can be used to override the default for a specific object, so that all of its properties can be edited.
In addition, the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/DomainObject.html#editingDisabledReason[@DomainObject#editingDisabledReason] can be used to specify the reason why a property cannot be edited.

It's also possible to override the class-level default on a per-property basis, using the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/Property.html#editing[@Property#editing] attribute.
A reason can also be specified at the property level using link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/Property.html#editingDisabledReason[@Property#editingDisabledReason].
There are therefore three levels at which property editing can be defined:

    global configuration < @DomainObject < @Property

This works in the opposite direction also: if the global config property is to _allow_ properties to be edited, then the `@DomainObject#editing` (or `@Property#editing`) could be used to disable editing.
Such a setup is likely to be much less common, though.


== How this demo works

The collection on the left shows a set of entity instances, which use `@DomainObject#editing` to enable editing of their properties.
However, `@Property#editing` is then used to disable the "originalName" property.
The "initialCharacter" property cannot be edited either, because it is a derived property (has only a getter).

Navigate through to the entity in order to edit its properties, and to see the corresponding source code.

In terms of code:

* the entity is defined thus:
+
[source,java]
----
include::jpa/DomainObjectEditingEntityImpl.java[tags=class]
----
<.> indicates that the properties of this type may be edited, overriding the global default set by  configuration property.
<.> editable property because of the `@DomainObject#editing` annotation
<.> this property cannot, after all, be edited, with `@Property#editing` overriding `@DomainObject#editing`.
See section below for further discussion.
<.> also a non-editable property, but this time because it is a derived property.



== Configuration property

To disable/enable editing globally, use:

[source,yaml]
.application.yml
----
causeway:
  applib:
    annotation:
      domain-object:
        editing: false    # false | true
----
