The link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/Property.html#fileaccept[@Property#fileAccept] attribute is used to indicate a file extension when browsing for a file to upload:

* for properties, the attribute can be specified using the `@Property` annotation

* for parameters, the attribute can be specified using the `@Parameter` annotation

This attribute applies only to ``Blob``s and ``Clob``s.


== How this demo works

This page object has two properties, `pdfProperty` and `txtProperty`.
The first is a `Blob` which is intended to hold only PDF files, while the second is a `Clob` that is intended to hold just `.txt` files.
Both properties can be edited directly, and can also be updated using an action.
Either way, the file extension that is acceptable is specified.

In terms of code:

* for the `pdfProperty`:

** to edit it directly:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.PropertyFileAcceptPage.java
----
include::PropertyFileAcceptPage.java[tags=pdf]
----
<.> explicitly specifies that only PDFs can be accepted for the property

** to update using an action:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.PropertyFileAcceptPage_updatePdf.java
----
include::PropertyFileAcceptPage_updatePdf.java[tags=pdf]
----
<.> explicitly specifies that only PDFs can be accepted for the parameter

* for the `txtProperty` similarly:

** to edit it directly:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.PropertyFileAcceptPage.java
----
include::PropertyFileAcceptPage.java[tags=txt]
----
<.> explicitly specifies that only PDFs can be accepted for the property

** to update using an action:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.PropertyFileAcceptPage_updateTxt.java
----
include::PropertyFileAcceptPage_updateTxt.java[tags=txt]
----
<.> explicitly specifies that only `.txt` files can be accepted for the parameter
